- **Build Automation**: Use Gradle, which is included with most Forge/Fabric templates, to automate builds. IntelliJ integrates seamlessly with Gradle.
- **Local Testing with CurseForge**:
    - Package your modâ€™s `.jar` file using Gradle (`gradlew build`).
    - Import the `.jar` file into your local CurseForge instance for testing.
- **Automated Testing and CI**: Optionally, set up GitHub Actions to automatically build and test your mod on every pull request.
